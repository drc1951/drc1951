Howdy! My name is David Cross and I am a professor/director at TCU.  I use Aquamacs, R, and LaTeX in my work, 
but at the moment am not doing much, if any, programming.  I joined GitHub primarily so I can support Aquamacs, 
but now that I am here, I am curious to see what all is going on here.  d.cross@tcu.edu
